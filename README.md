# league_ranker
League Ranker is a Python tool that ranks teams based on game results. Given a file of scores, it processes each game, awards points for wins, draws, and losses, and outputs a ranked list of teams sorted by points (with ties broken alphabetically). It's robust, handling varied inputs and edge cases, and includes thorough testing for reliability.
